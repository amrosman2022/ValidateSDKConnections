<h1>Service Endpoints Connectivity Validation App</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
LaunchDarkly capabilities are exposed through a set of SDK endpoints that gets called by the customer application using the different SDKs supporting the respective platform the customer is using. 

To make sure LD customers are ready for implementing the platform, one of the prequisits, being the validation of connectivity from the different networks / servers that will access LaunchDarkly services. To validate the connectivity customers need to run CURL commands for the different SDK endpoints to ensure the routes are open from their network to LaunchDarkly. 

This simple JS/Python App calls the different endpoints and shows which SDK endpoints have connectivity.

<h2>How</h2>
The App is composed of 2 components:<BR>
  1- JS/HTML UI the calls a Python API that should be running on the customer network/server(s) that need to be validated for connectivity.<BR>
  2- Python API running on the customer server(s)/endpoint(s) which calls the LaunchDarkly SDKs

<h2>Steps</h2>
1- Run the Python app "**Python3** LD_SDK_Checker.py" <BR>
2- Open the “index.html” on any browser (see notes below).<BR>
3- Click on “Validate Connections” button to start. The process should run in 5-10 seconds.<BR>
4- Connection results will show on the “Flag Deliver Network” section of the screen, either as green=valid or red=invalid connections.<BR>
5- Tracing messages will show on the bottom section of the screen for more details.<BR>

<h3><i>Notes:</i></h3>
- JS/HTML page is Serverless, and can be run on any browser.<BR>
- The IP address for the Python API need to be updated in the JS/HTML page. In the below code the IP address is assumed to be a local address.<BR>
